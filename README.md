# Module_5_Matplot_Challenge

I am looking at panel data covering the performance of a pharmaceutical drug in mice and drawing correlative results using simple linear regression and binning techniques. Visualization will include bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and quartile spreads.

## Pymaceuticals folder
Contains one folder and one Jupyter Notebook. The resource folder holds the two initial CSVs for the assignment, which are imported and cleaned as data frames in the Jupyter Notebook.
